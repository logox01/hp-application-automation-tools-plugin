<div>
    This build step is intended to support execution of automated tests from Micro Focus ALM Octane.</br>
    The builder searches for the "testsToRun" parameter which is sent from ALM Octane as part of the execution framework.</br>
    Once it is found, its value is converted to the format of the selected testing framework, and injected to the "testsToRunConverted" environment parameter.</br>
    Later, the new parameter can be used in the appropriate execution builder.
    <ul>
        <li> To use in other parameter textboxes, use the following syntax: <b>${testsToRunConverted}</b></li>
        <li> To use in the scripts, use the following syntax: (Windows) <b>%testsToRunConverted%</b>, and (Linux) <b>$testsToRunConverted</b>. For example : mvn clean -Dtest=%testsToRunConverted% test</li>
    </ul>
    </br>
    </br>
    For <b>UFT</b> only: In order to build a UFT MTBX file, this builder needs to know the test check-out directory. By default this is the job workspace directory.
    If tests are checked out in another directory, define in the job a String parameter "testsToRunCheckoutDirectory" with the correct directory.
